    "text": "2.1 Rates of voting for each car group split: implication for identification\nWe present a simple comparison of the Lega voting rates, voting changes, and other outcomes by each car-ownership group. The table below captures the ‘main effect’ the authors investigate. Euro 4 diesel fuel owners supported Lega more in the post-policy European elections, relative to Euro 4 gas owners. This also held for Euro 4 diesel fuel owners relative to diesel fuel owners in other classes. However, for these same comparisons in an earlier (2018) election, the rates of voting for Lega were fairly similar, or even went in the opposite direction. The second table below enables sorting by diesel or class, to aid this consideration.\nFurthermore, the base rates of Lega voting were similar in order-of-magnitude, suggesting that the choice of functional form might not matter so much (see discussion below).\n\nCode# Assuming dts is your data frame\ndts %>%\n  group_by(euro_class, diesel) %>%\n  summarise(\n    mn_lega_18 = if(n() >= 50) mean(vote_lega_2018, na.rm = TRUE) else NA,  # Calculate mean if group size >= 10\n    mn_lega_euro = if(n() >= 50) mean(vote_lega_euro, na.rm = TRUE) else NA,  # Calculate mean if group size >= 10\n    count = n(), # Count of observations\n    .groups = \"drop\" # Drop grouping structure after summarization\n  ) %>% \n  filter(!is.na(mn_lega_18)) %>% # Remove groups with less than 10 observations\n  kable(caption = \"Voting for Lega by Euro category and fuel tyle\", format = \"html\", escape = FALSE, digits=2) %>%\n      kable_styling\n\n\n\nVoting for Lega by Euro category and fuel tyle\n \n euro_class \n    diesel \n    mn_lega_18 \n    mn_lega_euro \n    count \n  \n\n\n 4 \n    FALSE \n    0.12 \n    0.18 \n    122 \n  \n\n 4 \n    TRUE \n    0.13 \n    0.24 \n    293 \n  \n\n 5 \n    FALSE \n    0.19 \n    0.22 \n    171 \n  \n\n 5 \n    TRUE \n    0.14 \n    0.15 \n    120 \n  \n\n 6 \n    FALSE \n    0.19 \n    0.24 \n    170 \n  \n\n 6 \n    TRUE \n    0.17 \n    0.17 \n    133 \n  \n\n 998 \n    FALSE \n    0.49 \n    0.51 \n    55 \n  \n\n\n\nCodedts %>%\n  group_by(euro_class, diesel) %>%\n  summarise(\n    mn_lega_18 = if(n() >= 50) mean(vote_lega_2018, na.rm = TRUE) else NA,  # Calculate mean if group size >= 10\n    mn_lega_euro = if(n() >= 50) mean(vote_lega_euro, na.rm = TRUE) else NA,  # Calculate mean if group size >= 10\n    count = n(), # Count of observations\n    .groups = \"drop\" # Drop grouping structure after summarization\n  ) %>% \n  filter(!is.na(mn_lega_18)) %>% # Remove groups with less than 10 observations\n    mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ round(., 3))) %>%  # Round all numeric columns to 3 decimal places\n  DT::datatable()"

I (David Reinstein) believe their identification implicitly depends on\n\neach of the unmeasured underlying characteristics (picked up by the proxy control in ‘difference’) each being associated with the voting outcome linearly on ‘percentage point voting for Lega’ … so the each the\n\nBut the treated and groups might have started from a different baseline level of voting for Lega – (however, as we saw above, these were order-of-magnitude similar).\nIf the true model is nonlinear (e.g., proportional, or with ceiling effects), the results here may be misleading. E.g., suppose the true effect of the policy on voting was the same for each car-ownership group as a percentage of the initial vote. Inappropriately estimating a linear model would find a substantial ‘difference in difference’ between these groups, even though the effect did not interact with car ownership itself.\nChen and Roth (2023) cite Wooldridge 2023\n\nAn alternative identifying assumption is to impose that, in the absence of treatment, the percentage changes in the mean would have been the same for the treated and control group. As in Wooldridge (2023), this can be formalized using a “ratio” version of the parallel trends assumption,\n\n[ = ]\nWe probably don’t have time to test for proportional trends (as well as limited data for a powerful test). But it seems an equally-plausible model off-the cuff. Chen and Roth offer an estimation strategy\n\nConveniently, this estimate can also be obtained using Poisson QMLE to estimate \\(Y_{it} = \\exp(\\beta_0 + D_i \\times Post_t \\beta_1 + D_i\\beta_2 + Post_t\\beta_3)\\epsilon_{it}\\)\n\n\nand then computing \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{ATT\\%} = \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_1) - 1 = -0.82\\) as shown in column (1) of Table 6.\n\nEstimate this as a logit model? Other specifications like proportional hazards? Roth recommends Quasi-poisson See section 5.2, “A DiD setting: Sequeira (2016)”\nWe re-ran the model as a Poisson model.

    "text": "Background:\n\nmajor ban on polluting cars introduced in Milan, which was strongly opposed by the populist right party Lega.\n\n\nThe policy identifies the most polluting categories of vehicles and bans them from accessing and circulating within the area.\n\nMain claim:\n ~'This policy caused people [who were financially hurt] to vote for Lega'. [or more generally to be more right wing]\n\n\n\n\nthe difference in the differences of outcomes by emission category, that is, between Diesel versus Petrol owners of Euro4, and Diesel versus Petrol owners of Euro5.\"\n\nIn general this is a ‘difference in differences’ without a time dimension, although some of their regressions control for previous voting record.\n\nOur main dependent variable is an indicator that takes the value 1 if the respondent reports voting for Lega, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nthe average estimated effect is 13.5 percentage points … the baseline rate of support for Lega in the sample was 24.4%. … owning a car affected by the vehicle ban raised the probability of voting for Lega in the subsequent elections by 55% above the baseline rate\"\n\n\n\n\n\nelectoral change did not stem from a broader shift against environmentalism, but rather from disaffection with the policy's uneven pocketbook implications\n\nThey also argue that ~‘people who were compensated did not shift in response to the policy’.\nThese are implicitly claims of (1) null or bounded effects and (2) differential effects (for those compensated vs. those not compensated.) This is important to the authors’ theoretical interpretation of the effect, and its generalization to political behavior as a whole.\n\n\n\n\nThe paper’s results could be reconstructed from the data and code provided, with only a moderate amount of effort\nWe also recoded the construction of their replication data from the survey data they provided and their description. There were no discrepancies.\nWe considered a handful of alternate specifications and robustness checks. The qualitative results were preserved in every case we examined.1"
