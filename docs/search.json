[or more generally to be more right wing]\nBackground: \"The policy identifies the most polluting categories of vehicles and bans them from accessing and circulating within the area.\" \n\n\n1.3.2 Main evidence for this claim:\n\nthe difference in the differences of outcomes by emission category, that is, between Diesel versus Petrol owners of Euro4, and Diesel versus Petrol owners of Euro5.\"\n\n(Note it’s a difference in differences without a time dimension, although they later consider vote switches) \n\nOur main dependent variable is an indicator that takes the value 1 if the respondent reports voting for Lega, and 0 otherwise.\n\n\nthe average estimated effect is 13.5 percentage points … the baseline rate of support for Lega in the sample was 24.4%. … owning a car affected by the vehicle ban raised the probability of voting for Lega in the subsequent elections by 55% above the baseline rate\"\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Secondary claim(s)/other key claims:\n\nelectoral change did not stem from a broader shift against environmentalism, but rather from disaffection with the policy's uneven pocketbook implications\n\nThey also, ~‘people who were compensated did not shift in response to the policy’.\nThese are implicitly claims of (1) null or bounded effects and (2) differential effects (for those compensated vs. those not compensated.) This is important to the authors’ theoretical interpretation of the effect, and its generalization to political behavior as a whole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColantone, Italo, Livio Di Lonardo, Yotam Margalit, and Marco Percoco. 2024a. “The Political Consequences of Green Policies: Evidence from Italy—CORRIGENDUM.” American Political Science Review 118 (1): 545–48.\n\n\n———. 2024b. “The Political Consequences of Green Policies: Evidence from Italy—CORRIGENDUM.” American Political Science Review 118 (1): 545–48."

I (David Reinstein) believe their identification implicitly depends on\n\neach of the unmeasured underlying characteristics (picked up by the proxy control in ‘difference’) each being associated with the voting outcome linearly on ‘percentage point voting for Lega’ … so the each the\n\nBut the treated and groups might have started from a different baseline level of voting for Lega (check this)\nIf the true model is nonlinear (e.g., proportional, or with ceiling effects), the results here may be misleading. E.g., suppose the true effect of the policy on voting was the same for each car-ownership group as a percentage of the initial vote. Inappropriately estimating a linear model would find a substantial ‘difference in difference’ between these groups, even though the effect did not interact with car ownership itself.\nChen and Roth (2023) cite Wooldridge 2023\n\nAn alternative identifying assumption is to impose that, in the absence of treatment, the percentage changes in the mean would have been the same for the treated and control group. As in Wooldridge (2023), this can be formalized using a “ratio” version of the parallel trends assumption,\n\n[ = ]\nWe probably don’t have time to test for proportional trends (as well as limited data for a powerful test). But it seems an equally-plausible model off-the cuff. Chen and Roth offer an estimation strategy\n\nConveniently, this estimate can also be obtained using Poisson QMLE to estimate \\(Y_{it} = \\exp(\\beta_0 + D_i \\times Post_t \\beta_1 + D_i\\beta_2 + Post_t\\beta_3)\\epsilon_{it}\\)\n\n\nand then computing \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{ATT\\%} = \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_1) - 1 = -0.82\\) as shown in column (1) of Table 6.\n\nEstimate this as a logit model? Other specifications like proportional hazards? Roth recommends Quasi-poisson See section 5.2, “A DiD setting: Sequeira (2016)”\nWe re-ran the model as a Poisson model.
