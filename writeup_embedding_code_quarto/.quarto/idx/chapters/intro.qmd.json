(2024, APSR)](#writeup)\n\n## Background and goals\n\nWe are 'robustness replicating' @colantone2024political (also noting @colantone2024political_cor) for a replication game (see [Institute for replication](i4rep.org)\n\nMain goals\n\n1.  Computationally reproduce key results (do they computationally hold up, especially the 'main claims'). See ['Computational replication'](#computational).\n\n2.  Robustness checks: Consider alternate plausible specifications and approaches; do the results persist? See ['Robustness checks'](#robustness)\n\n3.  Methodological (if time permits): critique methodology, provide further analysis (e.g., multiple hypothesis testing corrections, equivalence tests)\n\n## The paper's main claim, evidence\n\n###  **Main claim:**\n\n \\~\\'This policy caused people \\[who were financially hurt\\] to vote for Lega\\'. \\[or more generally to be more right wing\\]\n\nBackground: \\\"The policy identifies the most polluting categories of vehicles and bans them from accessing and circulating within the area.\\\" \n\n### **Main evidence for this claim:** \n\n> the difference in the differences of outcomes by emission category, that is, between Diesel versus Petrol owners of Euro4, and Diesel versus Petrol owners of Euro5.\\\"\n\n(Note it's a difference in differences without a time dimension, although they later consider vote switches) \n\n\n> Our main dependent variable is an indicator that takes the value 1 if the respondent reports voting for Lega, and 0 otherwise.\n\n> the average estimated effect is 13.5 percentage points ... the baseline rate of support for Lega in the sample was 24.4%. ... owning a car affected by the vehicle ban raised the probability of voting for Lega in the subsequent elections by 55% above the baseline rate\\\"\n\n### **Secondary claim(s)/other key claims:** \n\n> electoral change did not stem from a broader shift against environmentalism, but rather from disaffection with the policy\\'s uneven pocketbook implications\n\nThey also, \\~'people who were *compensated* did *not* shift in response to the policy'\n\nThese are implicitly claims of (1) null or bounded effects and (2) *differential* effects (for those compensated vs. those not compensated.) This is important to the authors' theoretical interpretation of the effect, and its generalization to political behavior as a whole.\n\n## IGNORE CONTENT BELOW\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Expand To Learn About Collapse\n\nThis is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse=\"true\"` to collapse it by default or `collapse=\"false\"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.\n:::\n\n## Create an object to see if it crosses chapters\n\n```{r create-xtest}\n\n\nxtest <- 24\n\n```\n\n## Example of inline code\n\nBefore we defined the object `xtest` (see previous code block). You can also use integrate short code blocks into the narrative using \"inline code\" ... Type `r xtest` and the *value* of the object `xtest` shows up in your code, here `r xtest`.\n\n## Showing some material\n\nWhat if I want the code to be folded but not to spit results and side effects onto the screen?\n\n```{r}\n#| results: false\n#| label: hideresults\n\n3+5\n\na <- \"happiness\"\n\n```\n\n`r a`\n\nDid it display the sum? Was the object defined?\n\n## Labeling/captioning chunks\n\nWait, why do we just have 'code' labeling the chunks when you fold them. It would be much more useful to have a descriptive label you can see in the html. We can do this in each chunk with `#| code-summary: \"blah blah\"`, as below\n\nNote: the chunk options content itself is not shown. Below, we have:\n\n```         \n#| label: car-talk\n#| code-summary: \"Car talk stuff\"\n\nhead(mtcars)\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| label: car-talk\n#| code-fold: true\n#| code-summary: \"Car talk stuff\"\n\nhead(mtcars)\n\n```\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":true,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"message":false,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":true,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"intro.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.113","comments":{"hypothesis":true},"bibliography":["../references.bib"],"theme":"cosmo","citations-hover":true,"footnotes-hover":true},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
