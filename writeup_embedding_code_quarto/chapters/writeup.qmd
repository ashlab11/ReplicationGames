## Abstract

[Summary of the key findings from the original study and this replication effort]

## Introduction

[Brief overview of the original study, its research question, data, and methods]

### Original Study

[Brief description of the original study's main findings and conclusions]

## Computational Reproducibility

[Description of the process of computationally reproducing the original study's results using the provided replication package]

See chapter @ref(computational),

### Discrepancies and Coding Errors

[Discussion of any discrepancies or coding errors found during the computational reproduction process]

## Robustness Reproduction and Replication

See chapter @ref(robustness),

[Explanation of the robustness checks and replication efforts undertaken, including changes to the sample period, clustering of standard errors, or other modifications]

### Regression Model

[Description of the regression model(s) used in the original study and any modifications made for the robustness checks or replication]

#### Results: [Outcome Variable 1]

##### Clustering

[Discussion of the results when the clustering of standard errors is modified, including any changes in the sign, magnitude, or statistical significance of the estimates]

### Results: [Outcome Variable 2]

[Repeat sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 for additional outcome variables]
