# Preface {.unnumbered}

We are 'robustness replicating' @colantone2024political (also noting @colantone2024political_cor) for a replication game (see [Institute for replication](i4rep.org))

All of our computational replication and additional results should be constructable by sourcing the file `main.R` in our root directory. (However, packages may need to be installed.)

```{r}
options(knitr.duplicate.label = "allow")

```
